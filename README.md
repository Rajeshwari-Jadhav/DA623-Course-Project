# ðŸŒ¸ Bharatanatyam Mudra Recognition & Mapping App

This is a two-page **Streamlit web application** designed to recognize and map **Bharatanatyam mudras (hand gestures)** using computer vision and text-based search. It leverages a CNN classifier for gesture recognition and a custom mapping tool to link mudras with meanings and shlokas.

## ðŸŒŸ Application Pages

### 1. **Mudra Image Classifier**

* Upload or capture an image of a **Bharatanatyam mudra**.
* The app uses a trained **CNN-based classifier** to predict the corresponding mudra.
* Built using:
  * A **custom CNN model** (from scratch)
  * A **pre-trained MobileNetV2 model** (for improved accuracy and performance)

### 2. **Mudra Mapper**

* Search mudras by **Sanskrit word** or **meaning**.
* Paste a **Sanskrit shloka** to retrieve relevant mudras.
* Displays:
  * Matching **mudra names**
  * **Descriptions** of the mudras
  * **Reference images**
